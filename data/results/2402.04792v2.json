{"title": "Direct Language Model Alignment from Online AI Feedback", "abstract": "Direct alignment from preferences (DAP) methods, such as DPO, have recently emerged as efficient alternatives to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), that do not require a separate reward model. However, the preference datasets used in DAP methods are usually collected ahead of training and never updated, thus the feedback is purely offline. Moreover, responses in these datasets are often sampled from a language model distinct from the one being aligned, and since the model evolves over training, the alignment phase is inevitably off-policy. In this study, we posit that online feedback is key and improves DAP methods. Our method, online AI feedback (OAIF), uses an LLM as annotator: on each training iteration, we sample two responses from the current model and prompt the LLM annotator to choose which one is preferred, thus providing online feedback. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate via human evaluation in several tasks that OAIF outperforms both offline DAP and RLHF methods. We further show that the feedback leveraged in OAIF is easily controllable, via instruction prompts to the LLM annotator.", "sections": {"Introduction": "\nTo maximise the benefits of large language models (LLMs) to society, it is important to align them with human expectations and values (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a; Bubeck et al., 2023) . The first method introduced for alignment was reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF, Christiano et al., 2017; Stiennon et al., 2020) , which trains a reward model (RM) from pairwise preferences and then optimises a policy against the RM via reinforcement learning (RL). More recently, direct alignment from preferences (DAP) methods have emerged as popular alternatives to RLHF, such as direct preference optimisation (DPO, Rafailov et al., 2023) , sequence likelihood calibration with human feedback (SLiC, Zhao et al., 2023) , and identity policy optimisation (IPO, Azar et al., 2023) . In contrast to RLHF, the DAP methods directly update the language model (a.k.a. policy) \u03c0 \u03b8 using pairwise preference data, making the alignment simpler, more efficient and more stable (Rafailov et al., 2023) .\nHowever, the preference datasets used in DAP methods are often collected ahead of training and the responses in the dataset are usually generated by different LLMs. Thus, the feedback in DAP methods is usually purely offline, as \u03c0 \u03b8 cannot get feedback on its own generations over training. This is problematic because of the significant distribution shift between the policy that generated the dataset and the policy being aligned: we train on the distribution induced by \u03c1 but evaluate on the distribution induced by \u03c0 \u03b8 in the end. In contrast, in RLHF, the RM provides online feedback to generations from \u03c0 \u03b8 during the RL step. This practice leads to on-policy learning, which was shown to improve exploration and overall performance (Lambert et al., 2022) .\nInspired by RL from AI feedback (RLAIF) (Bai et al., 2022b; Lee et al., 2023) , we hereby propose Online AI Feedback (OAIF) for DAP methods. Our method inherits both the practical advantages of DAP methods and the online nature of RLHF. Specifically, when aligning an LLM policy \u03c0 \u03b8 , we follow a three-step procedure: 1) we sample two responses to a prompt from the current policy \u03c0 \u03b8 ; 2) we obtain online feedback over the two responses by prompting an LLM to mimic human preference annotation; 3) we use this online feedback to update the model \u03c0 \u03b8 through standard DAP losses. Our approach is depicted in Figure 1 . Unlike methods proposed by Xu et al. (2023) ; Liu et al. (2023) ; Xiong et al. (2023) , OAIF skips the RM training, and directly extracts the preference from an LLM.\nTo show the effectiveness of our proposal, we perform an extensive empirical comparison between OAIF, existing offline DAP methods and RLHF methods. Our experimental protocol uses both AI and human evaluation on standard LLM alignment tasks: TL;DR (Ziegler et al., 2019) , Anthropic Helpfulness and Figure 1 : Summary of the proposed online AI feedback (OAIF) approach for making direct alignment from preferences (DAP) methods online and on-policy. Given an input prompt x, two responses y 1 and y 2 are first sampled from the current language model \u03c0 \u03b8 t , then labelled as y `and y \u00b4by the LLM annotator. The language model parameters are then updated using the objective function of DAP methods.\nHarmlessness (Bai et al., 2022a) . To summarise, we make the following contributions.\n\u2022 We demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of OAIF for turning offline DAP methods (DPO, IPO, SLiC) into online methods. Our human evaluation shows that the average win rate of online DAP methods (DPO, IPO, SLiC) over offline versions of the same methods is \"66%.\n\u2022 We confirm the usefulness of making DAP methods online: human raters favour DPO with OAIF (thus, online DPO) over SFT baseline, RLHF and RLAIF 58.00% of time on the TL;DR task in 4-way comparisons.\n\u2022 We demonstrate the controllability of the LLM annotator, by injecting specific instructions into the prompts. We use response length as a test-bed. By asking the LLM annotator to prefer shorter responses, the average length of responses from the aligned policy is significantly shortened from \"120 to \"40, while its quality is still improved over the SFT baseline.", "Background": "\nPairwise preference collection. Current methods for LLM alignment first collect a dataset of pairwise preferences, as follows. A prompt x is sampled from a prompt distribution p X , then two distinct responses y 1 and y 2 are sampled independently from an existing LLM \u03c1. Then, human (Christiano et al., 2017) or AI annotators (Lee et al., 2023) rank the responses, yielding a preferred response y `and a less preferred one y \u00b4. With some abuse of notation, we assume that there exists a function that uniquely maps py 1 , y 2 q to py `, y \u00b4q, and we will therefore write py `, y \u00b4q \" \u03c1p\u00a8|xq.\nA preference dataset D \" tpx i , y \u00ec , y \u00ed qu N i\"1 is then constructed by repeating the above process N times.\nDirect alignment from preference (DAP) methods. DAP methods directly update the target policy \u03c0 \u03b8 from the preference pairs py `, y \u00b4q. The loss functions for the three main DAP methods investigated in this work are summarised below. They take the form \u2113px, y `, y \u00b4, \u03b8q for a prompt x \" p X , a response pair py `, y \u00b4q \" \u03c1p\u00a8|xq and model parameters \u03b8.\n\u2022 DPO loss:\n\u00b4log \u03c3 \u02c6\u03b2 log \u03c0 \u03b8 py `|xq\u03c0 \u03b8 0 py \u00b4|xq \u03c0 \u03b8 0 py `|xq\u03c0 \u03b8 py \u00b4|xq \u02d9(1)\n\u2022 IPO loss:\nEQUATION\n\u2022 SLiC loss: max \u02c60, 1 \u00b4\u03b2 log \u02c6\u03c0\u03b8 py `|xq\u03c0 \u03b8 0 py \u00b4|xq \u03c0 \u03b8 py \u00b4|xq\u03c0 \u03b8 0 py `|xq", "\u02d9\u02d9(3)": "\nwhere \u03c0 \u03b8 0 is the SFT baseline used as reference, \u03c3 is the logistic function, and \u03b2 is a scalar hyperparameter. We emphasise once again that py `, y \u00b4q are sampled from \u03c1p\u00a8|xq, not from \u03c0 \u03b8 t p\u00a8|xq, as this will be the key difference with the online variant we propose in the next section. One advantage of these loss functions is that their gradients The responses (y 1 , y 2 ) sampled from the current model \u03c0 \u03b8 t differ from preference dataset responses (y `, y \u00b4) sampled from \u03c1, as \u03c1 \u2030 \u03c0 \u03b8 t . Two independent distribution shifts can occur: an initial distribution shift (\u03c1 \u2030 \u03c0 \u03b8 0 ) and a gradual distribution shift (\u03c0 \u03b8 0 \u2030 \u03c0 \u03b8 t ) during the alignment procedure.\n\u2207 \u03b8 \u2113px, y `, y \u00b4, \u03b8q can be computed exactly in an efficient way. In contrast, because the loss function used in RLHF involves an expectation over the space of responses (Ziegler et al., 2019) , policy gradient methods are typically used to obtain an unbiased estimate of the gradient and a value function is typically used to reduce the variance, which requires storing an additional model in memory.\nOffline feedback. In most real-world applications, due to the financial cost and complexity of collecting pairwise preferences from human annotators, the preference dataset D is usually collected ahead of aligning a language model \u03c0 \u03b8 and kept fixed throughout training. Obtaining online preferences on new responses is usually not feasible, as there is no human-in-the-loop. Using a fixed dataset D makes all preference data offline, which means the policyfoot_0 \u03c0 \u03b8 cannot get feedback on its own generations on-the-fly over the alignment procedure. It is worth mentioning that the RL step in RLHF and RLAIF is online as the training data is acquired interactively. See Appendix A.1 for an in-depth discussion on online vs. offline feedback.\nOff-policy learning. Beyond the offline feedback problem illustrated above, aligning an LLM policy \u03c0 \u03b8 with DAP methods on a pre-collected dataset D also yields a distribution shift between the generation from the policy \u03c1 and the policy \u03c0 \u03b8 t at each time step t. This makes the alignment off-policy as \u03c0 \u03b8 t \u2030 \u03c1 and \u03c0 \u03b8 t keeps evolving over learning. This shift problem is illustrated in Figure 2 . We also provide an empirical verification of this problem in Appendix B. In DPO, this problem is tackled by supervised finetuning \u03c0 \u03b8 on D so that \u03c0 \u03b8 0 \u00ab \u03c1 , but the off-policy issue remains during alignment as \u03c0 \u03b8 t gradually departs from \u03c0 \u03b8 0 . Thanks to the online nature of RL, RL methods are also on-policy, as the responses used to update \u03c0 \u03b8 t are all sampled from it. See Appendix A.2 for more details on on-policy vs. off-policy learning in LLMs.\nRM-based online feedback for DAP methods. To avoid the distribution shifts arising when aligning LLMs with offline DAP methods on a given dataset D, an intuitive and straightforward solution is to introduce an RM to provide online feedback. Liu et al. (2023) proposed RSO, a method that uses an RM to perform rejection sampling in order to sample from the optimal policy, which improved the alignment compared to offline DAP baselines. Besides, pseudo-labelling the generations from \u03c0 \u03b8 t by RMs can also be helpful, as done in the Iterative DPO method (Xu et al., 2023) and the West-of-N method (Pace et al., 2024) . Although the aforementioned RM-based methods make the alignment of a policy online and on-policy, the distribution shift problem still exists when training the RM. More specifically, the RM is trained on the preference dataset D \" \u03c1, but used to annotate preference over responses from \u03c0 \u03b8 t at training step t, where \u03c0 \u03b8 \u2030 \u03c1. Therefore, RM-based online feedback cannot fully avoid distribution shift issues.\nLLM-based online feedback for DAP methods. The method we propose next, \"Online AI Feedback\" (OAIF), consists in using an LLM as an online annotator. Our method relies on the observation that LLMs can approximate well human labelling and can generate reliable preferences over responses (Lee et al., 2023) . In recent concurrent work, Yuan et al. (2024) proposed a \"self-rewarding\" approach, in which the policy being aligned provides online feedback to itself. In comparison, OAIF can leverage feedback from any LLM, including ones stronger than the LLM being aligned. Swamy et al. (2024) also concurrently investigates the importance of online preference, but still relying on RMs.\nIn Table 1 , we summarise the characteristics of OAIF and of the existing offline and online DAP methods.", "Direct alignment from online AI feedback": "\nBridging the gap. As we saw, DAP methods are simple, do not require a separate RM, but they use preference data pre-collected offline. On the other hand, RLHF methods interact online with the language model being aligned, but they require policy gradient techniques to obtain an unbiased gradient estimate and a value function to reduce the variance.\nTo bridge the gap between these two families of methods, we propose a simple yet effective way to make DAP methods online.\nAs pointed out by Ziegler et al. (2019) , online data collection is crucial for aligning language models. To solve the aforementioned offline problem in DAP methods, we propose to collect preferences on-the-fly for responses generated by the language model being aligned. Naturally, using human feedback would be prohibitively expensive. Prior studies have shown that AI feedback is a reliable and effective approximation to human labellers, especially for pairwise preference labelling (Lee et al., 2023) . We therefore propose to use an LLM as online annotator, in order to collect the preference over pairs of responses, sampled from \u03c0 \u03b8 t on-the-fly during its alignment. We refer to the proposed approach as OAIF, which stands for online AI feedback.\nProposed algorithm. An overview of OAIF is given in Figure 1 , and a more formal description is provided in Algorithm 1 (for simplicity, we use batches of size 1). Given a prompt x, sampling y 1 , y 2 from \u03c0 \u03b8 t p\u00a8|xq ensures on-policy learning. Prompting the annotating LLM to obtain y `, y \u00e9nsures online learning. We emphasise that the approach is general and works with any differentiable DAP loss function \u2113px, y `, y \u00b4, \u03b8q.\nGradient computation. An important technical detail of online DAP methods is that \u03b8 is involved in both the response sampling and in the DAP loss function. In contrast, \u03b8 is involved only in the loss for offline DAP methods and only in the sampling for RLHF methods. In addition, using OAIF, the sampled responses go through an LLM annotator Algorithm 1 Online AI Feedback (OAIF) for Direct Alignment from Preference (DAP) methods Input:\nNumber of training steps T Prompt dataset D X \" tx i u N i\"1\nSFT baseline model \u03c0 \u03b8 0 An LLM annotator A DAP loss function \u2113px, y `, y \u00b4, \u03b8q 1: for t :\" 0 to T do 2:\nSample prompt x \" D X 3:\nSample response pair y 1 , y 2 \" \u03c0 \u03b8 t p\u00a8|xq 4:\nUse LLM annotator to get preference pair y `, y 5:\nUpdate \u03b8 t into \u03b8 t`1 using \u2207 \u03b8 \u2113px, y `, y \u00b4, \u03b8 t q 6: end for Output: Aligned language model (policy) \u03c0 \u03b8 T to obtain py `, y \u00b4q, which means that py `, y \u00b4q are also in principle functions of \u03b8. In practice, we propose to simply use \u2207 \u03b8 \u2113px, y `, y \u00b4, \u03b8q as our gradients, which amounts to placing a stop_gradient on both the sampling and LLM annotation steps.\nAnnotating prompts with text-controllability. We adopt a pairwise prompting scheme to collect AI feedback, i.e. we instruct the LLM annotator to choose which response is preferred among a pair, as in Lee et al. (2023) . To avoid position bias, we calculate scores for the two response possible orders and use the average as the final score. Since OAIF leverages prompting techniques to collect feedback, the reward signals or the preference function can be easily adapted by modifying the prompts (Sun et al., 2024) . This offers high flexibility without incurring any extra computation (such as retraining the RM) compared to RLHF and RLAIF. For example, in our experiments, we show that we can control the response length by simply prompting the annotator to prefer shorter responses.", "Experimental setup": "\nWe use three tasks for experiments: TL;DR (Stiennon et al., 2020) , Anthropic Helpfulness and Anthropic Harmlessness (Bai et al., 2022a) . For each task, we prepare the prompt dataset D X by simply extracting the input prompts from the preference dataset D. We adopt PaLM 2 (Anil et al., 2023) as the language model and also the LLM annotator. Unless otherwise specified, all policy models are initialised from the model obtained by supervised finetuning (SFT) PaLM 2-XS (Extra Small), which is referred to as the SFT baseline. For the annotating model, we use PaLM 2-L (Large). To obtain online feedback from the annotating model, we adopt the Detailed 0-shot prompt from Lee et al. (2023) . The prompts we used and how we get preference scores from them are detailed in Appendix E.\nTo demonstrate the generality of OAIF, we experiment with three DAP methods: DPO, IPO and SLiC. Based on preliminary experiments, we set \u03b2 \" 0.1 in DPO, \u03b2 \" 1.0 in IPO, and \u03b2 \" 0.002 in SLiC. We sample responses with a temperature of 0.9 during training. We adopt Adafactor (Shazeer & Stern, 2018) as the optimiser, and set the batch size to 128 and the learning rate to 5 \u00a810 \u00b47, with a warm-up period of 150 steps for all experiments. We evaluate models by computing win rates, i.e. how often one model's response is better than the other. For automatic evaluation, we apply the same prompting technique as above but with Gemini Pro (Gemini Team et al., 2023) to reduce the risk of overfitting and reward hacking (Gao et al., 2023) . The validity of Gemini Pro as the judge is explored in Appendix C. For human evaluation, three raters are presented with responses generated from a set of policy models. Each rater is then asked to independently score the responses' quality (from 1 to 5 where 5 denotes the highest) and to pick the best one, and the average score is then used to compare the models.", "How effective is OAIF for LLM alignment?": "\nWe start by examining the effectiveness of OAIF for DAP methods (that use online AI feedback), compared to their offline counterparts (that use pre-collected offline human preferences). As a sanity check, we track the win rate of DPO with OAIF (\"Online DPO\") and vanilla DPO (\"Offline DPO\") against the SFT baseline on TL;DR. The results are given in Figure 3 , where the results for RLAIF and RLHF are provided as references. Not surprisingly, both online and offline DPO improve the performance of the model, as shown by the substantially high win rate achieved against the SFT baseline. However, as indicated by the sharp drop of the red curve around training step 3, 500, offline DPO rapidly overfits the offline and off-policy preferences in D. In contrast, the win rate of online DPO keeps increasing over training, and surpasses offline DPO after 4, 000 steps. This demonstrates the effectiveness of OAIF. To consolidate the findings we got with Gemini Pro as automatic evaluator, the same experiment was also carried out with PaLM 2-L as the automatic evaluator. The results, given in Appendix D, confirm that our observations hold under both automatic evaluators. Next, we evaluate OAIF on different tasks, i.e., TL;DR, Helpfulness and Harmlessness. We select the best performing online and offline DPO models according to both manual inspection and their development set win rate against the SFT baseline by Gemini Pro. We then report side-by-side human evaluations comparing online DPO and offline DPO in Table 2 .", "Method": "\nHuman evaluation shows that OAIF significantly improves the performance of DPO across all tasks with substantial superiority over offline DPO. This consolidates our conclusion that using the offline feedback and off-policy generations in a pre-collected preference dataset D can be detrimental for LLM alignment, and OAIF benefits greatly from leveraging online and on-policy AI feedback.", "How does OAIF generalise to other DAP methods?": "\nAs shown in Algorithm 1, OAIF is compatible with arbitrary DAP loss functions. We therefore check the effectiveness of OAIF for IPO and SLiC. The side-by-side human evaluation results on TL;DR comparing the online and offline counterparts of these methods are given in Table 3 . Table 3 : Win/tie/loss rate of DAP methods with OAIF (online DPO/IPO/SLiC) against their offline counterparts in TL;DR along with the quality score of their generations, judged by human raters.", "Online": "\nCompared to their offline counterparts, DAP methods with OAIF achieve promising win rates, ranging from \"64% to \"71%. The consistent ineffectiveness of offline DAP methods confirms that the existence of the offline and off-policy issue in DAP methods and greatly hinders the performance of aligning LLMs. The consistent superiority of online DAP methods via OAIF against their offline counterparts demonstrates that OAIF is a general framework effectively addressing these challenges.", "How do DAP methods using OAIF perform compared to RLHF/RLAIF?": "\nUnderstanding the merits of DPO and RLHF is still a relatively open research question. We argue that comparing online DPO with RLAIF and RLHF, which is interesting on its own sake, can also contribute to answering this question.\nWe adopt similar experimental setups for RLAIF and RLHF as before, to make the comparison as fair as possible: we employ PaLM 2-L as the AI feedback model for RLAIF and use the same pre-collected preference dataset to train RMs for RLHF. Our training and optimisation procedures follow Lee et al. (2023) . Figure 4a shows the human evaluation results, where online DPO is more preferred than the other methods, in 58% of the time.\nWe emphasise that the RM used in RLAIF and RLHF is often not updated during policy training. As a result, its response assessment ability may not generalise, as the output distribution from \u03c0 \u03b8 t evolves. To verify this hypothesis, we also trained an online DPO with the same RM used for RLAIF. It outperforms RLAIF, but significantly underperforms online DPO with OAIF, with a win rate of \u010330% judged by Gemini Pro. This experimental result supports the superiority of using LLMs over RMs to provide online feedback. Synchronously retraining the RM is feasible theoretically (Ziegler et al., 2019) , but this would greatly complicate the training pipeline and increase training cost.\nDespite the great performance of OAIF compared to various baselines, we found that OAIF tends to produce significantly longer responses. This may affect the LLM and human evaluation as both evaluators often prefer long generations, referred to as \"length bias\" by Singhal et al. (2023) . To avoid the effect of such bias on analysing the performance of OAIF, we group the responses by their length, and plot the average quality score of each group. The results in Figure 4b show that online DPO with OAIF provides responses of higher quality than the other methods at fixed length, which further validates the effectiveness of OAIF. ", "How prompt-controllable is OAIF?": "\nWhile the necessity of LLM alignment has been widely recognised, what to align them with is still under debate, as human expectations vary greatly across regions and cultures, and may evolve over time. This indicates that the human preference annotation might change dramatically and frequently. In RLHF, such changes require re-annotating the preference dataset and re-training the RM, leading to high cost. In contrast, as OAIF is obtained through prompting the LLM annotator, its reward signal could be adjusted by simply modifying the prompts.\nTo examine this, we choose to explore the controllability of the length of responses by modifying the prompts to the LLM annotators. We take the online DPO model \u03c0 \u03b8 trained to be as helpful as possible in Section 4.2 as the reference. We further train another two online DPO models with the same experiment setup, but in which the annotator is prompted to favor \"helpful and short\" and \"helpful and very short\" responses. The exact prompts given to the LLM annotators are provided in Table 6 and Table 8 .\nWe display the average length of responses over training in Figure 6a . The \"short\" and \"very short\" prompts given to the LLM annotator significantly shorten the responses from \"120 tokens to \"90 and \"40 tokens respectively. This direct evidence demonstrates that the behaviour of policy \u03c0 \u03b8 can be significantly changed through prompting the annotating LLM differently, and the degree of the changes can be controlled as well.\nHowever, the above changes come at a cost. In Figure 6b , we plot the win rate of the \"helpful\", \"helpful and short\", and \"helpful and very short\" models against the initial SFT baseline. We noticed that the shorter responses become much less helpful, as judged by Gemini Pro. Nevertheless, they still improve the performance of the aligned model over the SFT baseline. This finding is also confirmed by human evaluation: from \"helpful\", \"helpful and short\" to \"helpful and very short\", the average quality score drops from 4.08, 3.72 to 3.26, all outperforming the SFT baseline (3.19) still.", "Can weaker AI labeller improve stronger LLM?": "\nSection 4.5 shows that PaLM 2-XS could provide reasonable feedback that helps improving the alignment of LLMs, although it's significantly smaller than PaLM 2-S/L. We argue that our approach offers an orthogonal solution to the weakto-strong generalisation problem investigated by Burns et al. (2023) . To verify that a weaker AI labeller can improve the performance of a stronger LLM model, we perform experiments using PaLM 2-S as the policy model (student) under two teacher settings: one with PaLM 2-XS (weaker teacher) and the other with PaLM 2-L (stronger teacher). The sideby-side automatic evaluation results on Helpfulness comparing against the SFT baseline and offline DPO are given in Figure 7 . We hereby emphasise the essential difference between the setup investigated by Burns et al. (2023) and ours. In their work, the tasks for the teacher and student model are both supervised learning tasks, thus they are of equal difficulty. However, in our work, the role of teacher is a simpler discriminative task (labelling preference), whereas the student model being aligned is given a more difficult one (generating proper responses). Following this perspective, our method is actually closer in spirit to the generative adversarial network proposed by Goodfellow et al. (2020) , but doesn't train a particular discriminator.", "Discussion": "\nLimitations. In this work, we study only the shift between distributions over responses, e.g. \u03c1py|xq and \u03c0 \u03b8 t py|xq. However, the shifts also happen on the user prompt distribution p X and the ground-truth human value function.\nAlthough the prompt-controllability of OAIF raises a possible solution to later case, the shift of p X is still a challenge. Since we extract prompts from the given preference dataset, our study assumes an in-distribution of prompts used for evaluation, thus lacks of evaluating the performance of aligned LLMs on out-of-distribution prompts. In the meantime, the model aligned in Section 4 is always PaLM 2-XS, thus whether our conclusion holds after scaling up is not investigated. As pointed out by Bai et al. (2022a) , it is harder to distinguish responses of higher quality. Therefore, how much can OAIF for responses from larger LLMs requires further study.\nSelf-annotating models. In all the experiments in Section 4, we aligned models \u03c0 \u03b8 using preferences generated by a separate LLM annotator. Yet, technically speaking, the feedback could also be from the model \u03c0 \u03b8 t being trained at time-step t. This method, used recently by Yuan et al. (2024) , is promising as outputting responses and annotating preferences are two distinct tasks, the former being a generative task and the latter a discriminative task. However, one disadvantage of this approach is that the model architecture and size have to be the same. In contrast, the LLM annotator in OAIF can be of arbitrary nature: as shown in Section 4.5, an LLM annotator of larger size brings additional benefits. Therefore, we argue that the choice of LLM annotator should not necessarily be limited to the model being aligned, especially when an LLM annotator of larger size or higher quality is available.\nQualitative preference annotation from LLMs. While we used response length as a simple test-bed, the promptcontrollability of reward signals can be naturally extended to more qualitative desiderata. Human values (such as helpfulness and impartiality) are a typical example of qualitative desiderata. Moreover, one motivation for annotating preferences instead of quantitative scores by human labellers is indeed because grading how well a response follows human values is difficult. Our approach, however, shows that AI feedback can achieve the same goal by changing only the prompts to the LLM annotators. Our approach can be extended to align language models to other qualitative objectives without much input from human labellers.\nPreference from real-time human feedback. In our work the online feedback is from LLM annotators, but it is technically plausible to replace them with real online users. In such case, the model can be aligned towards either a specific group of users or an individual user, and the key bottleneck becomes the sample efficiency for fine-tuning LLMs.\nDuring our experiment in Section 4.2, we found that the behaviour of a model can be visibly changed with \"2, 000 training steps, which requires \"256, 000 samples. To personalise an LLM, this amount of data is still way too much for an individual user to produce, which is a limitation of applying RLHF for single-user personalisation of LLMs.\nA common solution to improve sample efficiency is to use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2021) . However, aligning an LLM to a specific person requires several fundamental advances and we leave this to future research.", "Conclusion": "\nTo circumvent the offline feedback problem in direct alignment from preference (DAP) methods, such DPO, we proposed Online AI Feedback (OAIF), a simple and effective way to make DAP methods online via AI feedback. We carried out an extensive empirical evaluation, using both AI and human evaluation, which showed the effectiveness of DAP methods combined with OAIF, against their offline counterparts. We also exhibited the tendency of offline DAP methods to overfit, and in contrast the usefulness of OAIF as a way to mitigate reward overoptimization. We further verified the generality of OAIF, as our empirical results hold for three prominent DAP methods: DPO, IPO and SLiC.\nBeyond the empirical evaluation of OAIF, our work also contributes the comparison of two types of methods: online DAP methods (e.g., online DPO) and RLAIF. Since the feedback comes from identical models in both learning algorithms, our experiment setup ensures that the AI feedback is of the same quality and that only the learning procedures differ. Our experimental results in various tasks show that online DPO outperforms RLAIF and RLHF, which further confirms the effectiveness of OAIF, compared to offline feedback. Moreover, we used response length as a test bed to demonstrate that the LLM annotator can be controlled easily using instruction prompts. This shows that OAIF can be used to achieve desirable alignment goals.\nOverall, this work demonstrates the effectiveness and importance of OAIF for aligning LLMs, and paves the way for more scalable alignment strategies, requiring reduced human annotation effort.\n\u2022 Felipe Llinares: helped implement the initial codebase, helped setup the initial experiments.\n\u2022 Alexandre Ram\u00e9: contributed to the initial codebase, participated in discussions, gave comments on the paper.\n\u2022 Thomas Mesnard: helped implement initial codebase, gave comments on the paper.\n\u2022 Yao Zhao: contributed to the initial codebase, participated in discussions.\n\u2022 Bilal Piot: contributed to the codebase, participated in discussions, gave comments on the paper.\n\u2022 Johan Ferret, Mathieu Blondel: supervised the work, wrote the paper.\nAs can be seen from the above definitions and the ones in Appendix A.1, for DAP methods, offline DAP is also off-policy, as y \u00ec and y \u00ed are not sampled from the current policy. As a side note, it is technically possible for the online DAP to be off-policy, for instance if leveraging both online and offline data, but this practice is seldom used as of now.\nRegarding the RL step in RLHF and RLAIF, as shown by the objective function in Equation (4) as well as the common practice in RLHF and RLAIF, the response to be scored by the RM is always from \u03c0 \u03b8 t : max \u03b8 E x\"p X ,y\"\u03c0 \u03b8 py|xq \" rpx, y; \u03d5q \u00b4\u03b2 log \u02c6\u03c0\u03b8 py|xq \u03c0 \u03b8 0 py|xq \u02d9\u0237 .\nTherefore, the RL step in RLHF is on-policy. Although the RL step can be technically off-policy, if partially or exclusively learning from samples from different policies, we note that such practice is not widespread at the time of writing.\nTo sum up, the on-policy and off-policy learning is about whether the distribution over responses y \u00ec and y \u00ed learned from is \u03c0 \u03b8 t p\u00a8|x i q.", "A.3. Distribution shift between RM training and inference": "\nIn RLHF (and RLAIF), the RM is usually trained on a given set of preference triplets D \" tpx i , y \u00ec , y \u00ed qu N i\"1 . Suppose that the RM is trained on D \" \u03c1 and the LLM policy at training step t is \u03c0 \u03b8 t , the RM is then labelling:\n\u2022 in-distribution samples, if \u03c1 \" \u03c0 \u03b8 t , i.e. if doing online data collection (Ziegler et al., 2019) ;\n\u2022 out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, if \u03c1 \u2030 \u03c0 \u03b8 t , which is the most common practice in RLHF.\nIn short, when an RM is trained on D \" \u03c1 \u2030 \u03c0 \u03b8 t , there is then a shift between the RM training distribution (D \" \u03c1) and the RM inference distribution (\u03c0 \u03b8 t ).", "B. Distribution Shift in Preference Data Curation": "\nAs illustrated in Section 2 and Figure 2 , there might exist a distributional gap between samples from the preference dataset D and samples from the policy \u03c0 \u03b8 . To verify this gap, we use the preference dataset Stylistic-Continuation collected by Stiennon et al. (2020) based on GPT-2 Large (Radford et al., 2019) . In Stylistic-Continuation, each prompt x has a preferred summary y `and we randomly select a less preferred summary as y \u00b4. We treat GPT-2 Large as the policy model \u03c0 \u03b8 , thus both y `and y \u00b4are on-policy responses. We then synthesized an off-policy response \u0233 by sampling from PaLM 2 S (\u03c1, Anil et al., 2023) . Next, we inspect the log-probability of the preferred response y `, the less preferred response y \u00b4and the off-policy response \u0233 using GPT-2 Large, i.e. \u03c0 \u03b8 . As shown in Figure 8 , there is a clear margin between the log-probability of on-policy and off-policy responses, where GPT-2 Large assigns significantly lower probabilities to generations from PaLM 2-S. Thus, the results verify the existence of the distribution shift between the on-policy and off-policy preference data. Moreover, our experiments in Section 4.2 on comparing online and on-policy learning with offline and off-policy learning also indirectly shows the significance of solving this problem.\nC. Alignment Accuracy of Gemini Pro Lee et al. (2023) showed that the judgement of PaLM 2-L correlates significantly with human, thus we adopted PaLM 2-L for online feedback collection during the training. To reduce the risk of over-fitting, we resort to Gemini Pro (Gemini Team et al., 2023) instead for automatic evaluation at the test phase. However, the quality of Gemini Pro's judgement is not well studied yet.\nIn this section, we explore the correlation of Gemini Pro's judgement with human's judgement on the three datasets explored. Following Lee et al. (2023) Table 4 shows that Gemini Pro achieves an average alignment accuracy of 70.21%, which performs comparably to PaLM 2 L (70.72%). These results support our use of Gemini Pro for the judgement. ", "E. Prompts for LLM Evaluation and AI Feedback Labelling": "\nIn this section, we list the prompts used for OAIF and the automatic evaluation. Each prompt follows a pairwise selection paradigm (Lee et al., 2023) , which includes both responses apart from the input context and asks LLM to select the preferred one. In practice, we instruct LLM to produce a preference distribution by computing the softmax of the log-probabilities of generating the tokens \"1\" vs. \"2\". We treat the probability as the preference score, based on which we provide online AI\nThe most important part of the task is choosing which of the Assistant's responses is more helpful and honest.\nPlease consider the responses carefully, and use your overall judgment.

Note that this is subtle -if the context is about about a difficult personal situation, a helpful response might involve showing empathy and understanding. But if the context is about something practical, a helpful response may be a concise response, and not one that prolongs the interaction with irrelevant questions and comments. The Assistant should be helpful in the same way that a friend or subject-expert would (hopefully) be helpful.\nNote response containing \"Human:\" and/or \"Assistant:\" that tries to extend the conversation should be considered as not helpful and honest.\nYou are an expert rater of helpful and honest Assistant responses.

This makes the alignment process more straightforward and stable. Preferences are typically optimized by assessing the likelihood of pairwise preferred responses without the intermediary step of reward computation.\n\n2. **Online AI Feedback (OAIF):**\n   - In OAIF, \"live feedback\" is gathered by sampling two responses from the model during each iteration and using a large language model (LLM) to determine which response is preferred.

DPO directly utilizes pairwise preferences without a separate reward model by optimizing a preference-based loss, contrasting with RLHF requiring policy gradients and often involving reward models for unbiased gradient estimation. Preferences are measured by engaging annotators to select preferred responses, typically in a pairwise format. Details on measurement specifics would need clarity from other sections discussing empirical evaluations.\n\n2. **Online AI Feedback (OAIF)**: \"Live feedback\" is integrated by sampling response pairs from the current model and using an LLM to determine preference in real time.

This approach simplifies the alignment by directly leveraging annotated preferences within the training loop, focusing on real-time preference optimizations evaluated during training.\n   - **Preference Measurement**: Preferences are evaluated based on pairwise output comparisons by expert annotators or Large Language Models like PaLM 2-L, focusing on likelihood and win rate metrics during ongoing model updates.\n\n2. **Online AI Feedback (OAIF):**\n   - **Integration and Protocols**: OAIF integrates online feedback by sampling paired responses during iterations. A Large Language Model provides live annotations, enabling models to adapt dynamically to evolving output distributions. This continual feedback addresses distribution shifts better than static datasets.\n   - **Distribution Shifts Addressed**: OAIF focuses on responding to real-time changes in user prompts and model state, employing on-policy learning that dynamically corrects distribution shifts, therefore maintaining alignment integrity.\n\n3. **Experimental Setup:**\n   - **Task Specifics**: Tasks involve TL;DR summarization, Helpfulness, and Harmlessness evaluations. These tasks are structured around PaLM 2 models with defined parameters and settings, including specific datasets and model configurations described in the study's appendices.\n   - **Resources and Environment**: Experiments were conducted using GPUs and involved specific software and hardware configurations. This includes hyperparameter settings like learning rate adjustments and environmental setups referenced in the paper appendices.\n\n4. **Methodologies:**\n   - **Prompt-Controllability**: Prompts adjust model outputs based on desired outcomes, such as controlling response length or tone, through specific instructions within OAIF scoring. Examples and specific prompts are illustrated in figures, supporting flexible model behavior adjustment.\n   - **Efficient Gradient Computation with stop_gradient**: The \"stop_gradient\" technique minimizes computational redundancy, optimizing the learning process without introducing significant overhead typical of traditional reward model reliance. Reduced costs are achieved by bypassing separate reward model updates.\n\n5. **Human Evaluation and Statistical Significance:**\n   - **Criteria for Evaluation**: Human annotators assess models on stringent criteria, with results based on preference scores and performance in alignment tasks. Win/tie/loss rates bolster confidence in OAIF's superior efficacy against RLAIF and RLHF, supported by adequate sample sizes and robustness checks implied in study appendices.\n\n6. **Clarity and Reproducibility Enhancements:**\n   - **Organization and Presentation**: The paper features structured experimental results with detailed tables and figures reinforcing methodological claims. Additional clarity on statistical methods and sample sizes ensures comprehensive reproducibility for reviewers and practitioners.\n\n---\n\nWith these insights consolidated into a coherent document, the goal is now to finalize and complete the process.\n\n**READY**"]]}
