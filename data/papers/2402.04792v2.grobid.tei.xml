<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Direct alignment from preferences (DAP) methods, such as DPO, have recently emerged as efficient alternatives to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), that do not require a separate reward model. However, the preference datasets used in DAP methods are usually collected ahead of training and never updated, thus the feedback is purely offline. Moreover, responses in these datasets are often sampled from a language model distinct from the one being aligned, and since the model evolves over training, the alignment phase is inevitably off-policy. In this study, we posit that online feedback is key and improves DAP methods. Our method, online AI feedback (OAIF), uses an LLM as annotator: on each training iteration, we sample two responses from the current model and prompt the LLM annotator to choose which one is preferred, thus providing online feedback. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate via human evaluation in several tasks that OAIF outperforms both offline DAP and RLHF methods. We further show that the feedback leveraged in OAIF is easily controllable, via instruction prompts to the LLM annotator.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>To maximise the benefits of large language models (LLMs) to society, it is important to align them with human expectations and values <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ouyang et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bai et al., 2022a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bubeck et al., 2023)</ref>. The first method introduced for alignment was reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Christiano et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Stiennon et al., 2020)</ref>, which trains a reward model (RM) from pairwise preferences and then optimises a policy against the RM via reinforcement learning (RL). More recently, direct alignment from preferences (DAP) methods have emerged as popular alternatives to RLHF, such as direct preference optimisation (DPO, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Rafailov et al., 2023)</ref>, sequence likelihood calibration with human feedback (SLiC, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Zhao et al., 2023)</ref>, and identity policy optimisation (IPO, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Azar et al., 2023)</ref>. In contrast to RLHF, the DAP methods directly update the language model (a.k.a. policy) π θ using pairwise preference data, making the alignment simpler, more efficient and more stable <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Rafailov et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>However, the preference datasets used in DAP methods are often collected ahead of training and the responses in the dataset are usually generated by different LLMs. Thus, the feedback in DAP methods is usually purely offline, as π θ cannot get feedback on its own generations over training. This is problematic because of the significant distribution shift between the policy that generated the dataset and the policy being aligned: we train on the distribution induced by ρ but evaluate on the distribution induced by π θ in the end. In contrast, in RLHF, the RM provides online feedback to generations from π θ during the RL step. This practice leads to on-policy learning, which was shown to improve exploration and overall performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Lambert et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Inspired by RL from AI feedback (RLAIF) <ref type="bibr">(Bai et al., 2022b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lee et al., 2023)</ref>, we hereby propose Online AI Feedback (OAIF) for DAP methods. Our method inherits both the practical advantages of DAP methods and the online nature of RLHF. Specifically, when aligning an LLM policy π θ , we follow a three-step procedure: 1) we sample two responses to a prompt from the current policy π θ ; 2) we obtain online feedback over the two responses by prompting an LLM to mimic human preference annotation; 3) we use this online feedback to update the model π θ through standard DAP losses. Our approach is depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Unlike methods proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu et al. (2023)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Liu et al. (2023)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Xiong et al. (2023)</ref>, OAIF skips the RM training, and directly extracts the preference from an LLM.</p><p>To show the effectiveness of our proposal, we perform an extensive empirical comparison between OAIF, existing offline DAP methods and RLHF methods. Our experimental protocol uses both AI and human evaluation on standard LLM alignment tasks: TL;DR <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ziegler et al., 2019)</ref>, Anthropic Helpfulness and Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Summary of the proposed online AI feedback (OAIF) approach for making direct alignment from preferences (DAP) methods online and on-policy. Given an input prompt x, two responses y 1 and y 2 are first sampled from the current language model π θ t , then labelled as y `and y ´by the LLM annotator. The language model parameters are then updated using the objective function of DAP methods.</p><p>Harmlessness <ref type="bibr">(Bai et al., 2022a)</ref>. To summarise, we make the following contributions.</p><p>• We demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of OAIF for turning offline DAP methods (DPO, IPO, SLiC) into online methods. Our human evaluation shows that the average win rate of online DAP methods (DPO, IPO, SLiC) over offline versions of the same methods is "66%.</p><p>• We confirm the usefulness of making DAP methods online: human raters favour DPO with OAIF (thus, online DPO) over SFT baseline, RLHF and RLAIF 58.00% of time on the TL;DR task in 4-way comparisons.</p><p>• We demonstrate the controllability of the LLM annotator, by injecting specific instructions into the prompts. We use response length as a test-bed. By asking the LLM annotator to prefer shorter responses, the average length of responses from the aligned policy is significantly shortened from "120 to "40, while its quality is still improved over the SFT baseline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Background</head><p>Pairwise preference collection. Current methods for LLM alignment first collect a dataset of pairwise preferences, as follows. A prompt x is sampled from a prompt distribution p X , then two distinct responses y 1 and y 2 are sampled independently from an existing LLM ρ. Then, human <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Christiano et al., 2017)</ref> or AI annotators <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Lee et al., 2023)</ref> rank the responses, yielding a preferred response y `and a less preferred one y ´. With some abuse of notation, we assume that there exists a function that uniquely maps py 1 , y 2 q to py `, y ´q, and we will therefore write py `, y ´q " ρp¨|xq.</p><p>A preference dataset D " tpx i , y ì , y í qu N i"1 is then constructed by repeating the above process N times.</p><p>Direct alignment from preference (DAP) methods. DAP methods directly update the target policy π θ from the preference pairs py `, y ´q. The loss functions for the three main DAP methods investigated in this work are summarised below. They take the form ℓpx, y `, y ´, θq for a prompt x " p X , a response pair py `, y ´q " ρp¨|xq and model parameters θ.</p><p>• DPO loss:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">´log σ ˆβ log π θ py `|xqπ θ 0 py ´|xq π θ 0 py `|xqπ θ py ´|xq ˙(1)</formula><p>• IPO loss:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ˆlog ˆπθ py `|xqπ θ 0 py ´|xq π θ py ´|xqπ θ 0 py `|xq ˙´1 2β ˙2<label>(2)</label></formula><p>• SLiC loss: max ˆ0, 1 ´β log ˆπθ py `|xqπ θ 0 py ´|xq π θ py ´|xqπ θ 0 py `|xq</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>˙˙(3)</head><p>where π θ 0 is the SFT baseline used as reference, σ is the logistic function, and β is a scalar hyperparameter. We emphasise once again that py `, y ´q are sampled from ρp¨|xq, not from π θ t p¨|xq, as this will be the key difference with the online variant we propose in the next section. One advantage of these loss functions is that their gradients The responses (y 1 , y 2 ) sampled from the current model π θ t differ from preference dataset responses (y `, y ´) sampled from ρ, as ρ ‰ π θ t . Two independent distribution shifts can occur: an initial distribution shift (ρ ‰ π θ 0 ) and a gradual distribution shift (π θ 0 ‰ π θ t ) during the alignment procedure.</p><p>∇ θ ℓpx, y `, y ´, θq can be computed exactly in an efficient way. In contrast, because the loss function used in RLHF involves an expectation over the space of responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ziegler et al., 2019)</ref>, policy gradient methods are typically used to obtain an unbiased estimate of the gradient and a value function is typically used to reduce the variance, which requires storing an additional model in memory.</p><p>Offline feedback. In most real-world applications, due to the financial cost and complexity of collecting pairwise preferences from human annotators, the preference dataset D is usually collected ahead of aligning a language model π θ and kept fixed throughout training. Obtaining online preferences on new responses is usually not feasible, as there is no human-in-the-loop. Using a fixed dataset D makes all preference data offline, which means the policy<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> π θ cannot get feedback on its own generations on-the-fly over the alignment procedure. It is worth mentioning that the RL step in RLHF and RLAIF is online as the training data is acquired interactively. See Appendix A.1 for an in-depth discussion on online vs. offline feedback.</p><p>Off-policy learning. Beyond the offline feedback problem illustrated above, aligning an LLM policy π θ with DAP methods on a pre-collected dataset D also yields a distribution shift between the generation from the policy ρ and the policy π θ t at each time step t. This makes the alignment off-policy as π θ t ‰ ρ and π θ t keeps evolving over learning. This shift problem is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. We also provide an empirical verification of this problem in Appendix B. In DPO, this problem is tackled by supervised finetuning π θ on D so that π θ 0 « ρ , but the off-policy issue remains during alignment as π θ t gradually departs from π θ 0 . Thanks to the online nature of RL, RL methods are also on-policy, as the responses used to update π θ t are all sampled from it. See Appendix A.2 for more details on on-policy vs. off-policy learning in LLMs.</p><p>RM-based online feedback for DAP methods. To avoid the distribution shifts arising when aligning LLMs with offline DAP methods on a given dataset D, an intuitive and straightforward solution is to introduce an RM to provide online feedback. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Liu et al. (2023)</ref> proposed RSO, a method that uses an RM to perform rejection sampling in order to sample from the optimal policy, which improved the alignment compared to offline DAP baselines. Besides, pseudo-labelling the generations from π θ t by RMs can also be helpful, as done in the Iterative DPO method <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Xu et al., 2023)</ref> and the West-of-N method <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Pace et al., 2024)</ref>. Although the aforementioned RM-based methods make the alignment of a policy online and on-policy, the distribution shift problem still exists when training the RM. More specifically, the RM is trained on the preference dataset D " ρ, but used to annotate preference over responses from π θ t at training step t, where π θ ‰ ρ. Therefore, RM-based online feedback cannot fully avoid distribution shift issues.</p><p>LLM-based online feedback for DAP methods. The method we propose next, "Online AI Feedback" (OAIF), consists in using an LLM as an online annotator. Our method relies on the observation that LLMs can approximate well human labelling and can generate reliable preferences over responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Lee et al., 2023)</ref>. In recent concurrent work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yuan et al. (2024)</ref> proposed a "self-rewarding" approach, in which the policy being aligned provides online feedback to itself. In comparison, OAIF can leverage feedback from any LLM, including ones stronger than the LLM being aligned. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Swamy et al. (2024)</ref> also concurrently investigates the importance of online preference, but still relying on RMs.</p><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, we summarise the characteristics of OAIF and of the existing offline and online DAP methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Direct alignment from online AI feedback</head><p>Bridging the gap. As we saw, DAP methods are simple, do not require a separate RM, but they use preference data pre-collected offline. On the other hand, RLHF methods interact online with the language model being aligned, but they require policy gradient techniques to obtain an unbiased gradient estimate and a value function to reduce the variance.</p><p>To bridge the gap between these two families of methods, we propose a simple yet effective way to make DAP methods online.</p><p>As pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Ziegler et al. (2019)</ref>, online data collection is crucial for aligning language models. To solve the aforementioned offline problem in DAP methods, we propose to collect preferences on-the-fly for responses generated by the language model being aligned. Naturally, using human feedback would be prohibitively expensive. Prior studies have shown that AI feedback is a reliable and effective approximation to human labellers, especially for pairwise preference labelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Lee et al., 2023)</ref>. We therefore propose to use an LLM as online annotator, in order to collect the preference over pairs of responses, sampled from π θ t on-the-fly during its alignment. We refer to the proposed approach as OAIF, which stands for online AI feedback.</p><p>Proposed algorithm. An overview of OAIF is given in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, and a more formal description is provided in Algorithm 1 (for simplicity, we use batches of size 1). Given a prompt x, sampling y 1 , y 2 from π θ t p¨|xq ensures on-policy learning. Prompting the annotating LLM to obtain y `, y énsures online learning. We emphasise that the approach is general and works with any differentiable DAP loss function ℓpx, y `, y ´, θq.</p><p>Gradient computation. An important technical detail of online DAP methods is that θ is involved in both the response sampling and in the DAP loss function. In contrast, θ is involved only in the loss for offline DAP methods and only in the sampling for RLHF methods. In addition, using OAIF, the sampled responses go through an LLM annotator Algorithm 1 Online AI Feedback (OAIF) for Direct Alignment from Preference (DAP) methods Input:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Number of training steps T Prompt dataset D X " tx i u N i"1</formula><p>SFT baseline model π θ 0 An LLM annotator A DAP loss function ℓpx, y `, y ´, θq 1: for t :" 0 to T do 2:</p><p>Sample prompt x " D X 3:</p><p>Sample response pair y 1 , y 2 " π θ t p¨|xq 4:</p><p>Use LLM annotator to get preference pair y `, y 5:</p><p>Update θ t into θ t`1 using ∇ θ ℓpx, y `, y ´, θ t q 6: end for Output: Aligned language model (policy) π θ T to obtain py `, y ´q, which means that py `, y ´q are also in principle functions of θ. In practice, we propose to simply use ∇ θ ℓpx, y `, y ´, θq as our gradients, which amounts to placing a stop_gradient on both the sampling and LLM annotation steps.</p><p>Annotating prompts with text-controllability. We adopt a pairwise prompting scheme to collect AI feedback, i.e. we instruct the LLM annotator to choose which response is preferred among a pair, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lee et al. (2023)</ref>. To avoid position bias, we calculate scores for the two response possible orders and use the average as the final score. Since OAIF leverages prompting techniques to collect feedback, the reward signals or the preference function can be easily adapted by modifying the prompts <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Sun et al., 2024)</ref>. This offers high flexibility without incurring any extra computation (such as retraining the RM) compared to RLHF and RLAIF. For example, in our experiments, we show that we can control the response length by simply prompting the annotator to prefer shorter responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experiments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Experimental setup</head><p>We use three tasks for experiments: TL;DR <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Stiennon et al., 2020)</ref>, Anthropic Helpfulness and Anthropic Harmlessness <ref type="bibr">(Bai et al., 2022a)</ref>. For each task, we prepare the prompt dataset D X by simply extracting the input prompts from the preference dataset D. We adopt PaLM 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anil et al., 2023)</ref> as the language model and also the LLM annotator. Unless otherwise specified, all policy models are initialised from the model obtained by supervised finetuning (SFT) PaLM 2-XS (Extra Small), which is referred to as the SFT baseline. For the annotating model, we use PaLM 2-L (Large). To obtain online feedback from the annotating model, we adopt the Detailed 0-shot prompt from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lee et al. (2023)</ref>. The prompts we used and how we get preference scores from them are detailed in Appendix E.</p><p>To demonstrate the generality of OAIF, we experiment with three DAP methods: DPO, IPO and SLiC. Based on preliminary experiments, we set β " 0.1 in DPO, β " 1.0 in IPO, and β " 0.002 in SLiC. We sample responses with a temperature of 0.9 during training. We adopt Adafactor <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Shazeer &amp; Stern, 2018)</ref> as the optimiser, and set the batch size to 128 and the learning rate to 5 ¨10 ´7, with a warm-up period of 150 steps for all experiments. We evaluate models by computing win rates, i.e. how often one model's response is better than the other. For automatic evaluation, we apply the same prompting technique as above but with Gemini Pro (Gemini <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Team et al., 2023)</ref> to reduce the risk of overfitting and reward hacking <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Gao et al., 2023)</ref>. The validity of Gemini Pro as the judge is explored in Appendix C. For human evaluation, three raters are presented with responses generated from a set of policy models. Each rater is then asked to independently score the responses' quality (from 1 to 5 where 5 denotes the highest) and to pick the best one, and the average score is then used to compare the models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">How effective is OAIF for LLM alignment?</head><p>We start by examining the effectiveness of OAIF for DAP methods (that use online AI feedback), compared to their offline counterparts (that use pre-collected offline human preferences). As a sanity check, we track the win rate of DPO with OAIF ("Online DPO") and vanilla DPO ("Offline DPO") against the SFT baseline on TL;DR. The results are given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, where the results for RLAIF and RLHF are provided as references. Not surprisingly, both online and offline DPO improve the performance of the model, as shown by the substantially high win rate achieved against the SFT baseline. However, as indicated by the sharp drop of the red curve around training step 3, 500, offline DPO rapidly overfits the offline and off-policy preferences in D. In contrast, the win rate of online DPO keeps increasing over training, and surpasses offline DPO after 4, 000 steps. This demonstrates the effectiveness of OAIF. To consolidate the findings we got with Gemini Pro as automatic evaluator, the same experiment was also carried out with PaLM 2-L as the automatic evaluator. The results, given in Appendix D, confirm that our observations hold under both automatic evaluators. Next, we evaluate OAIF on different tasks, i.e., TL;DR, Helpfulness and Harmlessness. We select the best performing online and offline DPO models according to both manual inspection and their development set win rate against the SFT baseline by Gemini Pro. We then report side-by-side human evaluations comparing online DPO and offline DPO in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Human evaluation shows that OAIF significantly improves the performance of DPO across all tasks with substantial superiority over offline DPO. This consolidates our conclusion that using the offline feedback and off-policy generations in a pre-collected preference dataset D can be detrimental for LLM alignment, and OAIF benefits greatly from leveraging online and on-policy AI feedback.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">How does OAIF generalise to other DAP methods?</head><p>As shown in Algorithm 1, OAIF is compatible with arbitrary DAP loss functions. We therefore check the effectiveness of OAIF for IPO and SLiC. The side-by-side human evaluation results on TL;DR comparing the online and offline counterparts of these methods are given in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. Table <ref type="table">3</ref>: Win/tie/loss rate of DAP methods with OAIF (online DPO/IPO/SLiC) against their offline counterparts in TL;DR along with the quality score of their generations, judged by human raters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Online</head><p>Compared to their offline counterparts, DAP methods with OAIF achieve promising win rates, ranging from "64% to "71%. The consistent ineffectiveness of offline DAP methods confirms that the existence of the offline and off-policy issue in DAP methods and greatly hinders the performance of aligning LLMs. The consistent superiority of online DAP methods via OAIF against their offline counterparts demonstrates that OAIF is a general framework effectively addressing these challenges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">How do DAP methods using OAIF perform compared to RLHF/RLAIF?</head><p>Understanding the merits of DPO and RLHF is still a relatively open research question. We argue that comparing online DPO with RLAIF and RLHF, which is interesting on its own sake, can also contribute to answering this question.</p><p>We adopt similar experimental setups for RLAIF and RLHF as before, to make the comparison as fair as possible: we employ PaLM 2-L as the AI feedback model for RLAIF and use the same pre-collected preference dataset to train RMs for RLHF. Our training and optimisation procedures follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lee et al. (2023)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure">4a</ref> shows the human evaluation results, where online DPO is more preferred than the other methods, in 58% of the time.</p><p>We emphasise that the RM used in RLAIF and RLHF is often not updated during policy training. As a result, its response assessment ability may not generalise, as the output distribution from π θ t evolves. To verify this hypothesis, we also trained an online DPO with the same RM used for RLAIF. It outperforms RLAIF, but significantly underperforms online DPO with OAIF, with a win rate of ă30% judged by Gemini Pro. This experimental result supports the superiority of using LLMs over RMs to provide online feedback. Synchronously retraining the RM is feasible theoretically <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ziegler et al., 2019)</ref>, but this would greatly complicate the training pipeline and increase training cost.</p><p>Despite the great performance of OAIF compared to various baselines, we found that OAIF tends to produce significantly longer responses. This may affect the LLM and human evaluation as both evaluators often prefer long generations, referred to as "length bias" by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Singhal et al. (2023)</ref>. To avoid the effect of such bias on analysing the performance of OAIF, we group the responses by their length, and plot the average quality score of each group. The results in Figure <ref type="figure">4b</ref> show that online DPO with OAIF provides responses of higher quality than the other methods at fixed length, which further validates the effectiveness of OAIF. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">How prompt-controllable is OAIF?</head><p>While the necessity of LLM alignment has been widely recognised, what to align them with is still under debate, as human expectations vary greatly across regions and cultures, and may evolve over time. This indicates that the human preference annotation might change dramatically and frequently. In RLHF, such changes require re-annotating the preference dataset and re-training the RM, leading to high cost. In contrast, as OAIF is obtained through prompting the LLM annotator, its reward signal could be adjusted by simply modifying the prompts.</p><p>To examine this, we choose to explore the controllability of the length of responses by modifying the prompts to the LLM annotators. We take the online DPO model π θ trained to be as helpful as possible in Section 4.2 as the reference. We further train another two online DPO models with the same experiment setup, but in which the annotator is prompted to favor "helpful and short" and "helpful and very short" responses. The exact prompts given to the LLM annotators are provided in Table <ref type="table">6</ref> and Table <ref type="table">8</ref>.</p><p>We display the average length of responses over training in Figure <ref type="figure">6a</ref>. The "short" and "very short" prompts given to the LLM annotator significantly shorten the responses from "120 tokens to "90 and "40 tokens respectively. This direct evidence demonstrates that the behaviour of policy π θ can be significantly changed through prompting the annotating LLM differently, and the degree of the changes can be controlled as well.</p><p>However, the above changes come at a cost. In Figure <ref type="figure">6b</ref>, we plot the win rate of the "helpful", "helpful and short", and "helpful and very short" models against the initial SFT baseline. We noticed that the shorter responses become much less helpful, as judged by Gemini Pro. Nevertheless, they still improve the performance of the aligned model over the SFT baseline. This finding is also confirmed by human evaluation: from "helpful", "helpful and short" to "helpful and very short", the average quality score drops from 4.08, 3.72 to 3.26, all outperforming the SFT baseline (3.19) still.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7.">Can weaker AI labeller improve stronger LLM?</head><p>Section 4.5 shows that PaLM 2-XS could provide reasonable feedback that helps improving the alignment of LLMs, although it's significantly smaller than PaLM 2-S/L. We argue that our approach offers an orthogonal solution to the weakto-strong generalisation problem investigated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Burns et al. (2023)</ref>. To verify that a weaker AI labeller can improve the performance of a stronger LLM model, we perform experiments using PaLM 2-S as the policy model (student) under two teacher settings: one with PaLM 2-XS (weaker teacher) and the other with PaLM 2-L (stronger teacher). The sideby-side automatic evaluation results on Helpfulness comparing against the SFT baseline and offline DPO are given in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">7</ref>.  We hereby emphasise the essential difference between the setup investigated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Burns et al. (2023)</ref> and ours. In their work, the tasks for the teacher and student model are both supervised learning tasks, thus they are of equal difficulty. However, in our work, the role of teacher is a simpler discriminative task (labelling preference), whereas the student model being aligned is given a more difficult one (generating proper responses). Following this perspective, our method is actually closer in spirit to the generative adversarial network proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Goodfellow et al. (2020)</ref>, but doesn't train a particular discriminator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>Limitations. In this work, we study only the shift between distributions over responses, e.g. ρpy|xq and π θ t py|xq. However, the shifts also happen on the user prompt distribution p X and the ground-truth human value function.</p><p>Although the prompt-controllability of OAIF raises a possible solution to later case, the shift of p X is still a challenge. Since we extract prompts from the given preference dataset, our study assumes an in-distribution of prompts used for evaluation, thus lacks of evaluating the performance of aligned LLMs on out-of-distribution prompts. In the meantime, the model aligned in Section 4 is always PaLM 2-XS, thus whether our conclusion holds after scaling up is not investigated. As pointed out by <ref type="bibr">Bai et al. (2022a)</ref>, it is harder to distinguish responses of higher quality. Therefore, how much can OAIF for responses from larger LLMs requires further study.</p><p>Self-annotating models. In all the experiments in Section 4, we aligned models π θ using preferences generated by a separate LLM annotator. Yet, technically speaking, the feedback could also be from the model π θ t being trained at time-step t. This method, used recently by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yuan et al. (2024)</ref>, is promising as outputting responses and annotating preferences are two distinct tasks, the former being a generative task and the latter a discriminative task. However, one disadvantage of this approach is that the model architecture and size have to be the same. In contrast, the LLM annotator in OAIF can be of arbitrary nature: as shown in Section 4.5, an LLM annotator of larger size brings additional benefits. Therefore, we argue that the choice of LLM annotator should not necessarily be limited to the model being aligned, especially when an LLM annotator of larger size or higher quality is available.</p><p>Qualitative preference annotation from LLMs. While we used response length as a simple test-bed, the promptcontrollability of reward signals can be naturally extended to more qualitative desiderata. Human values (such as helpfulness and impartiality) are a typical example of qualitative desiderata. Moreover, one motivation for annotating preferences instead of quantitative scores by human labellers is indeed because grading how well a response follows human values is difficult. Our approach, however, shows that AI feedback can achieve the same goal by changing only the prompts to the LLM annotators. Our approach can be extended to align language models to other qualitative objectives without much input from human labellers.</p><p>Preference from real-time human feedback. In our work the online feedback is from LLM annotators, but it is technically plausible to replace them with real online users. In such case, the model can be aligned towards either a specific group of users or an individual user, and the key bottleneck becomes the sample efficiency for fine-tuning LLMs.</p><p>During our experiment in Section 4.2, we found that the behaviour of a model can be visibly changed with "2, 000 training steps, which requires "256, 000 samples. To personalise an LLM, this amount of data is still way too much for an individual user to produce, which is a limitation of applying RLHF for single-user personalisation of LLMs.</p><p>A common solution to improve sample efficiency is to use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hu et al., 2021)</ref>. However, aligning an LLM to a specific person requires several fundamental advances and we leave this to future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>To circumvent the offline feedback problem in direct alignment from preference (DAP) methods, such DPO, we proposed Online AI Feedback (OAIF), a simple and effective way to make DAP methods online via AI feedback. We carried out an extensive empirical evaluation, using both AI and human evaluation, which showed the effectiveness of DAP methods combined with OAIF, against their offline counterparts. We also exhibited the tendency of offline DAP methods to overfit, and in contrast the usefulness of OAIF as a way to mitigate reward overoptimization. We further verified the generality of OAIF, as our empirical results hold for three prominent DAP methods: DPO, IPO and SLiC.</p><p>Beyond the empirical evaluation of OAIF, our work also contributes the comparison of two types of methods: online DAP methods (e.g., online DPO) and RLAIF. Since the feedback comes from identical models in both learning algorithms, our experiment setup ensures that the AI feedback is of the same quality and that only the learning procedures differ. Our experimental results in various tasks show that online DPO outperforms RLAIF and RLHF, which further confirms the effectiveness of OAIF, compared to offline feedback. Moreover, we used response length as a test bed to demonstrate that the LLM annotator can be controlled easily using instruction prompts. This shows that OAIF can be used to achieve desirable alignment goals.</p><p>Overall, this work demonstrates the effectiveness and importance of OAIF for aligning LLMs, and paves the way for more scalable alignment strategies, requiring reduced human annotation effort.</p><p>• Felipe Llinares: helped implement the initial codebase, helped setup the initial experiments.</p><p>• Alexandre Ramé: contributed to the initial codebase, participated in discussions, gave comments on the paper.</p><p>• Thomas Mesnard: helped implement initial codebase, gave comments on the paper.</p><p>• Yao Zhao: contributed to the initial codebase, participated in discussions.</p><p>• Bilal Piot: contributed to the codebase, participated in discussions, gave comments on the paper.</p><p>• Johan Ferret, Mathieu Blondel: supervised the work, wrote the paper.</p><p>As can be seen from the above definitions and the ones in Appendix A.1, for DAP methods, offline DAP is also off-policy, as y ì and y í are not sampled from the current policy. As a side note, it is technically possible for the online DAP to be off-policy, for instance if leveraging both online and offline data, but this practice is seldom used as of now.</p><p>Regarding the RL step in RLHF and RLAIF, as shown by the objective function in Equation (4) as well as the common practice in RLHF and RLAIF, the response to be scored by the RM is always from π θ t : max θ E x"p X ,y"π θ py|xq " rpx, y; ϕq ´β log ˆπθ py|xq π θ 0 py|xq ˙ȷ .</p><p>Therefore, the RL step in RLHF is on-policy. Although the RL step can be technically off-policy, if partially or exclusively learning from samples from different policies, we note that such practice is not widespread at the time of writing.</p><p>To sum up, the on-policy and off-policy learning is about whether the distribution over responses y ì and y í learned from is π θ t p¨|x i q.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3. Distribution shift between RM training and inference</head><p>In RLHF (and RLAIF), the RM is usually trained on a given set of preference triplets D " tpx i , y ì , y í qu N i"1 . Suppose that the RM is trained on D " ρ and the LLM policy at training step t is π θ t , the RM is then labelling:</p><p>• in-distribution samples, if ρ " π θ t , i.e. if doing online data collection <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ziegler et al., 2019)</ref>;</p><p>• out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, if ρ ‰ π θ t , which is the most common practice in RLHF.</p><p>In short, when an RM is trained on D " ρ ‰ π θ t , there is then a shift between the RM training distribution (D " ρ) and the RM inference distribution (π θ t ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Distribution Shift in Preference Data Curation</head><p>As illustrated in Section 2 and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, there might exist a distributional gap between samples from the preference dataset D and samples from the policy π θ . To verify this gap, we use the preference dataset Stylistic-Continuation collected by <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Stiennon et al. (2020)</ref> based on GPT-2 Large <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Radford et al., 2019)</ref>. In Stylistic-Continuation, each prompt x has a preferred summary y `and we randomly select a less preferred summary as y ´. We treat GPT-2 Large as the policy model π θ , thus both y `and y ´are on-policy responses. We then synthesized an off-policy response ȳ by sampling from PaLM 2 S (ρ, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anil et al., 2023)</ref>. Next, we inspect the log-probability of the preferred response y `, the less preferred response y ´and the off-policy response ȳ using GPT-2 Large, i.e. π θ . As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">8</ref>, there is a clear margin between the log-probability of on-policy and off-policy responses, where GPT-2 Large assigns significantly lower probabilities to generations from PaLM 2-S. Thus, the results verify the existence of the distribution shift between the on-policy and off-policy preference data. Moreover, our experiments in Section 4.2 on comparing online and on-policy learning with offline and off-policy learning also indirectly shows the significance of solving this problem.</p><p>C. Alignment Accuracy of Gemini Pro <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lee et al. (2023)</ref> showed that the judgement of PaLM 2-L correlates significantly with human, thus we adopted PaLM 2-L for online feedback collection during the training. To reduce the risk of over-fitting, we resort to Gemini Pro <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gemini Team et al., 2023)</ref> instead for automatic evaluation at the test phase. However, the quality of Gemini Pro's judgement is not well studied yet.</p><p>In this section, we explore the correlation of Gemini Pro's judgement with human's judgement on the three datasets explored. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lee et al. (2023)</ref> Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> shows that Gemini Pro achieves an average alignment accuracy of 70.21%, which performs comparably to PaLM 2 L (70.72%). These results support our use of Gemini Pro for the judgement. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E. Prompts for LLM Evaluation and AI Feedback Labelling</head><p>In this section, we list the prompts used for OAIF and the automatic evaluation. Each prompt follows a pairwise selection paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Lee et al., 2023)</ref>, which includes both responses apart from the input context and asks LLM to select the preferred one. In practice, we instruct LLM to produce a preference distribution by computing the softmax of the log-probabilities of generating the tokens "1" vs. "2". We treat the probability as the preference score, based on which we provide online AI</p><p>The most important part of the task is choosing which of the Assistant's responses is more helpful and honest.</p><p>Please consider the responses carefully, and use your overall judgment. Ask yourself "did this response represent a thoughtful, honest, and reasonable attempt to either directly help me, or to converse with me to elicit information that will make it easier for the Assistant to help me later on in this conversation". Note that this is subtle -if the context is about about a difficult personal situation, a helpful response might involve showing empathy and understanding. But if the context is about something practical, a helpful response may be a concise response, and not one that prolongs the interaction with irrelevant questions and comments. The Assistant should be helpful in the same way that a friend or subject-expert would (hopefully) be helpful.</p><p>Note response containing "Human:" and/or "Assistant:" that tries to extend the conversation should be considered as not helpful and honest.</p><p>You are an expert rater of helpful and honest Assistant responses.

This dataset comprises previous interactions, which may have been generated by the same agent or different policies.</p><p>Let's now consider the setup of LLM alignment, following the notations we use in Section 2.</p><p>In DAP methods, suppose that the LLM policy at training step t is π θ t and the minibatch trained on is B " tpx i , y ì , y í qu.</p><p>The learning is then:</p><p>• online if py ì , y í q " f px, y 1 i , y 2 i q where f is an accessible preference function (either human labellers, RMs, or LLM annotators), and py 1 i , y 2 i q " π θ t p¨|x i q;</p><p>• offline if y ì and y í were generated from a potentially different policy ρ, ahead of training.</p><p>Therefore, in RLHF and RLAIF, their RL step is consistently online, as y is sampled on-the-fly from the current policy, and the RM is always accessible to score y over training. We discuss the RM step in RLHF and RLAIF separately in Appendix A.3.</p><p>To sum up, online vs offline learning is about whether the responses are generated by the current policy and the feedback is given on-the-fly by a preference function , or the responses along with the feedback are pre-collected and kept fixed.</p><p>A.2. On-policy learning vs off-policy learning</p><p>The concepts of on-policy and off-policy learning in RL <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Sutton &amp; Barto, 2018)</ref> are given as follows:</p><p>• On-policy learning refers to a scenario where the learning algorithm improves the policy based on data generated by the policy itself.</p><p>• Off-policy learning, on the other hand, leverages data obtained from a different policy than the one being trained.</p><p>Off-policy learning makes it possible to leverage the data generated by other models, or by previous versions of the policy.</p><p>In DAP methods, suppose the policy at training step t is π θ t and the batch we use to train it is B " tpx i , y ì , y í qu. The learning is then:</p><p>• On-policy if py ì , y í q " π θ t p¨|x i q, i.e. both y ì and y í are sampled from π θ t with x i as the input.</p><p>• Off-policy otherwise.</p><p>Therefore, DAP methods are off-policy if preference data comes from ρ. Note that the conclusion is still true even if ρ " π θ 0 , since π θ keeps changing over training and π θ t ‰ π θ 0 for t ‰ 0. By contrast, the approach proposed in this work is an on-policy alternative, as responses are sampled from the current policy at each training step.</p><p>feedback and compute the win rate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lee et al. (2023)</ref> observed that the order of the two responses when instantiating the prompt has non-negligible impact on the selection, i.e. the so-called positional bias. To address this issue, we average the distribution over "{response1} vs. {response2}" and "{response2} vs. {response1}".</p><p>A good summary is a shorter piece of text that has the essence of the original. It tries to accomplish the same purpose and conveys the key information from the original post. Below we define four evaluation axes for summary quality: coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality.</p><p>Coherence: This axis answers the question "how coherent is the summary on its own?" A summary is coherent if it's easy to understand when read on its own and free of English errors. A summary is not coherent if it's difficult to understand what the summary is trying to say. Generally, it's more important that the summary is understandable than it being free of grammar errors.</p><p>Accuracy: This axis answers the question "does the factual information in the summary accurately match the post?" A summary is accurate if it doesn't say things that aren't in the article, it doesn't mix up people, and generally is not misleading.</p><p>Coverage: This axis answers the question "how well does the summary cover the important information in the post?" A summary has good coverage if it mentions the main information from the post that's important to understand the situation described in the post. A summary has poor coverage if someone reading only the summary would be missing several important pieces of information about the situation in the post. A summary with good coverage should also match the purpose of the original post (e.g. to ask for advice).</p><p>Overall quality: This axis answers the question "how good is the summary overall at representing the post?" This can encompass all of the above axes of quality, as well as others you feel are important. If it's hard to find ways to make the summary better, the overall quality is good. If there are lots of different ways the summary can be made better, the overall quality is bad.</p><p>You are an expert summary rater. Given a piece of text and two of its possible summaries, output 1 or 2 to indicate which summary best adheres to coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality as defined above.</p><p>Text -{text} Summary 1 -{summary1} Summary 2 -{summary2}</p><p>Preferred Summary=</p><p>Table <ref type="table">5</ref>: The prompt used for generating AI feedback (and rating) for TL;DR summarization. {text} is the unlabeled input context, {summary1} and {summary2} are candidates generated from policy model.</p></div>

The Assistant should be helpful in the same way that a friend or subject-expert would (hopefully) be helpful. Meanwhile, the Assistant should avoid being offensive and discriminatory, and aiding dangerous or illegal acts. When providing sensitive or consequential advice, the Assistant must do it with modesty and care!
