Task: Write a list of feedback comments, similar to the suggestions a reviewer might make. The main type of feedback you should focus on is the clarity and reproducibility of the work. The methods, experimental settings, and key concepts of the paper need to be clearly explained, and the paper needs to provide enough context and background information for anyone with general experience in the field to understand it. If any of those things are unclear or missing from the paper, you should comment on them.

Once you have established what the methods, experiments , and key concepts of the paper are, you should carefully scrutinize whether they are clearly explained and detailed or if they need to be improved.

Important: expert ({expert}) doesn't have a paper chunk, but they are good at coming up with questions that test the paper's clarity. Explain the paper to {expert} and answer any questions they have until they say they are finished. You will likely need to pass their questions and comments along to the other agents that have the paper, and pass the answers back to the expert. Write feedback based on any points {expert} indicates are in need of improvement. Important! Remember that expert cannot see your discussion with other reviewers, so you will have to summarize and explain the content of the paper to {expert} in order to get expert feedback and comments.

Think carefully in a logical, step-by-step way. Ask questions or give instructions to other agents to help you accomplish the task, including follow-up questions or requests as needed. Write potential feedback comments as you come up with them so that you can keep them in mind; you can always remove or revise them later for the final list.
